A not so great version of one of these written in Rust:

Can be run using  
```bash
cargo run --release
# WARNING
# Generates a file about 30MB in size the first time it is run.
# If use-large-words-file is true, this creates a file 5GB(!!) in size.
```

You can also use the `settings.toml` file to adjust the program's settings.
